# IoT-Home-Guard


IoT-Home-Guard is a project to help people discover malware in home smart devices. It contains a software tool and a hardware tool.

If you find that your smart device in your home has strange behavior, or if you only suspect that a device has been implanted with a Trojan, you can use these tools to confirm.

I have now completed the first version of the software and hardware. I will complete the second version by October, when the user experience and the number of identifiable devices will be greatly improved.
